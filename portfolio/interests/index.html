        <h2><span class="green-monospace">03.</span> What I'm Pursuing</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            My career plan is to become an Information Technology (IT) Consultant operating across nations.
            I like to work in firms of management consultants, software and systems houses within large
            manufacturers of computing equipment, or occasionally internally in major industrial companies.
            The above said areas are some of the places IT Consultants work. For I desire to work in
            partnership with clients, advising them how to use information technology in order to meet
            their business objectives or overcome problems. Consultants work to improve the structure and
            efficiency of organization’s IT systems. Common job tasks IT Consultants do which I see as part
            of my career aspirations and goals include:
          </p>
          <ul class="skill-list">
            <li>Analyze IT requirements within companies and give independent and objective advice on the use of IT.
            </li>
            <li>Provide specialist support and back-up to professionals within client companies.</li>
            <li>Advise on strategic planning and operational efficiency.</li>
            <li>May run facilities for clients.</li>
            <li>Design, develop and test new systems.</li>
            <li>Train staff in new systems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Part of my career goals/aspirations is to gain growth in resources, that is upgrading my knowledge and
            resources to grow as a professional, better salary, job satisfaction, experience such as learning about
            the cultures of different countries, meeting new people and basically becoming familiarized with customs
            and traditions worldwide. This will enable me to increase my tolerance level and change perspectives and
            job stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accomplishing this goal is a long journey since I am still an undergraduate student but every long journey
            begins with a step. It is a challenging and technical aspiration though I have a passion for it because it
            is my dream and there after I want to be part any of the big corporations here in Australia.

          I am currently taking networks subject right now, and I am amazed on how things are built
          and work behind the scenes. I really do want to learn the basic and advance things about
          networks. For I know that it is not just on the physical state, but there is also some inner
          things about this. I wish to create the fastest internet connection here in the Philippines
          to be able to download, upload, and communicate faster over the Web.

          It is very obvious that every IT Professional should learn how to program. Even he only knows
          one programming language. To be able to speak in different language or dialect is to be able
          to communicate also with the computer. I dream of becoming a part of Google in the future.

          My weakness. I really don’t know how to be creative as much as possible with every work I do.
          It’s really difficult for me to have a design of my own and implementing it to be good or even
          better. I am really pushing myself to learn new things to improve myself on such skill.

          It started when I was in high school. Third year high school. There are a lot of school
          activities offered in our school, but this was something new. Exciting. Different.
          Everything seems to be complicated, and difficult, but I guess it’s just at the beginning.
          Web development is actually fun, and at the same time, fun to do. I guess, someday, I will
          be a web developer in a prestigious company innovating how the web looks and how it feels.
